# Plan Tasks

Thoroughly review the [Plan document](.planning/PLAN.md) and produce a detailed Markdown checkbox formatted [Task list](.planning/TASKS.md). The task list will be shared between human and coding agents. The task list must group tasks into discrete units of work, and NOT move on to other tasks before the current task is completed. After each task is completed, the progress should be updated on the task list. Any tests or code quality processes should be run at the end of a task. The task can only be committed after ALL quality checks and tests pass.

* Review [Plan document](.planning/PLAN.md)
* Produce detailed logically grouped Markdown checkbox [Task list](.planning/TASKS)
* Each task MUST be completed before proceeding to next tasks
* Tasks can only be considered complete after all tests and quality checks pass
* Only commit completed tasks when all checks pass
