# Implement Task List

Iterate through the tasks defined in the [Task list](.planning/TASKS.md) thoroughly and methodically. Each task should be completed in its entirety before proceeding to the next task ensuring all tests and code quality checks pass.

After the completion of each task:

* Ensure all code quality and tests pass. ALL checks must pass, NO exceptions.
* Task list updated to mark task complete.
* Commit should be created with the appropriate title and description describing the task and the changes made
