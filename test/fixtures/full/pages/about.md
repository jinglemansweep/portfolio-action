## About Jane

I am a full-stack developer based in Bristol, UK, with over 10 years of
experience building web applications.

### My Journey

I started programming during university and never looked back. Today I
specialise in **React**, **Node.js**, and **cloud infrastructure**.

### Interests

Outside of coding, I enjoy:

- Contributing to open-source projects
- Speaking at local meetups
- Hiking in the Mendip Hills
