## Looking Ahead

This post should be excluded from builds before its publish date.

The web platform continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Here are my predictions
for what will shape development in 2027.

### Prediction 1: WebAssembly Everywhere

WebAssembly will become the default compilation target for performance-critical
web applications.

### Prediction 2: AI-Assisted Development

AI coding assistants will be integrated into every major IDE and CI pipeline.
