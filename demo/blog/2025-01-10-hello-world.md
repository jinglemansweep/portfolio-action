## Welcome

After years of meaning to start a blog, I've finally done it. This site is built
with **Instant Portfolio**, a GitHub Action that turns YAML and Markdown into a
full portfolio site — no framework, no bundler, just static files.

### What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Software architecture** — patterns and trade-offs I encounter in real projects
- **Developer tooling** — the CLIs, editors, and workflows that keep me productive
- **Open-source life** — lessons learned from maintaining libraries used by thousands

### Why Now?

I've spent the last decade learning from other people's writing. Blog posts,
conference talks, and open-source READMEs shaped the way I think about software.
It's time I started giving back.

Stay tuned — there's more to come.
