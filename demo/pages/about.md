## Hello, I'm A. N. Other

I'm a software engineer based in London with over a decade of experience building
products people love. My career has taken me from scrappy startups to scaling
platforms serving thousands of organisations.

### What I Do

By day I lead platform architecture at **CloudScale Inc.**, where I design
event-driven systems that handle millions of requests. By night you'll find me
tinkering with open-source projects or writing about software craft.

### What Drives Me

- **Simplicity** — the best systems are the ones you can reason about
- **Mentorship** — helping others grow is the most rewarding part of the job
- **Open source** — building in public makes everyone's work better

### Beyond the Code

When I step away from the keyboard I enjoy long-distance running, experimenting
with sourdough baking, and exploring London's indie coffee scene.
